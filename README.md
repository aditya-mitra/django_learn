### Strucuturing

- core app functionalities *(like amdin, models)* should be kept in a `core` folder
- functionalities which vary *(like serializers, urls, views)* should be kept in its own **named** folder

### django_app_online_store

 - No rest_framework involved

#### Notes

- `pip` command works when the virtual env is activated
